### Additional Features

- Uncensored
- Better GUI
- Selecting of specific faces in source/target possible
- Batch processing of all image/video files in a folder
- Selection of face enhancer engine

Users of this software are expected to use this software responsibly while abiding the local law. If a face of a real person is being used, users are suggested to get consent from the concerned person and clearly mention that it is a deepfake when posting content online.

### Installation

> For Windows, you need to download and install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/) (in theory build-tools might work too but in my experience so far they don't). During the install, make sure to at least include the C++ package and perhaps Python as well.

Besides that, just use the 1-click installer in releases. This will download and install everything
in a handy conda environment. This not only installs the application but also runs it, once installed.


For other OS or if you'd rather like to do this by yourself then:

- `git clone https://github.com/C0untFloyd/roop-unleashed`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Depending on your system and available GPU there are different packages you need to install and different commandline args. Here are the instructions from the original roop page:

[Using GPU Acceleration](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/wiki/2.-Acceleration)

For Video face-swapping you also need to have ffmpeg properly installed (having it in your PATH Env). The windows installer tries to do this automatically.  


To enable usage of your GPU however, you need to add the commandline argument to your windows_run.bat e.g.

> REM Please set the following commandline arguments to your prefered settings
set COMMANDLINE_ARGS=--execution-provider cuda --frame-processor face_swapper face_enhancer --video-encoder libvpx-vp9

This would set acceleration to NVIDIA Cuda, enable swapping and enhancements and use the latest video encoder. Please look below for an overview of possible commandline arguments.



### Usage

- Windows: run the `windows_run.bat` from the Installer. Edit the .bat file to add your desired commandline arguments 
- Linux: `python run.py (and optional commandline arguments)`

Additional command line arguments are given below. To find out what they do, check [this guide](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/wiki/Advanced-Options).

  --execution-provider {coreml,cpu} [{coreml,cpu} ...]     available execution provider (choices: cpu, ...)
  --execution-threads EXECUTION_THREADS                    number of execution threads
  -v, --version                                            show program's version number and exit
```

New options not present in base roop:

**option:** `-f TARGET_FOLDER`
**default:** `unset`

Specifies a folder with images/videos to batch process. When using this option, output path needs to be a folder path only. Final names will be automatically created from source. 

**option:** `--source-face_index`
**default:** `0`

Selects the face to use as source, if there are multiple persons in that image

**option:** `--target-face_index`
**default:** `0`

Selects the face to use as target, if there are multiple persons in that image


Looking for a CLI mode? Using the -s/--source argument will make the run program in cli mode.

> Note: When you run this program for the first time, it will download some models ~300MB in size.


### Example

Let's assume we want to swap the faces in this image
![originalimage](docs/kickboxing.jpg)
to the faces of a person looking like Elon Musk and a person looking similar to Zuckerberg.
Selecting a source image with a face of Musk and using the originalimage from above as target, there will be a face-selection dialogue, looking like this:
![face-selection](docs/faceselection.png)

After clicking on the face of your choice, this will be remembered and clicking on Start, specifying the output filename will begin the swapping process.  
When this is finished you view the resulting image/video by clicking on Show Result.

After additionally swapping a face looking like Zuckerberg onto the right dude, my final result looks like this:

![finalimage](docs/finaloutput.png)

It's almost the same procedure with videos but for the face selection you need to specify the frame number where your target face is visible (default: 1).
